# The Challenge

Your company needs you to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) - using the language of your choice - which will be utilized by other teams in your organization. Initially, this BST only needs to support integers and must include all methods of a BST. 
Additionally, include a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth, and include a method for building the BST from an array of integers.
Requirements
Implement a BST and all its methods
The BST must be built from an array of integers
Implement a method that returns the deepest nodes in the BST along with their depth

Example:
  Input: 12,11,90,82,7,9
	Output: deepest, 9; depth, 3	
  Input: 26, 82, 16, 92, 33
	Output: deepest, 33, 92; depth, 2

What we are looking for
Correctness - will your solution produce the desired results
Conciseness - does your solution balance clarity and brevity
Maintainability - does your code stand up to changing needs
Anti-patterns - does your solution avoid anti-patterns
How to submit
Share the code in a GitHub Public Repository
What to expect
We are not looking to stump you with a complex problem, we simply want to see how you think and code. After you submit your work, our team will review it and then discuss the solution with you. 
During this time we will ask you to share your screen and potentially do some modifications.
